      <h1>Measuring the Competitiveness at Tennis Majors from 2000-2016</h1>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>After I published my previous <a href="../majors-scor/">analysis of scorelines at tennis majors</a>, many asked for a 
      more detailed examination. Ben Rothenberg of <i>The New York Times</i>, the inspiration for that analysis, tweeted: 
      <q>...curious also about how often fourth or fifth sets are uncompetitive because one guy is gassed/dispirited, compared to BO3.</q></p>

      <p>In response, I've taken a deeper look at the ebbs and flows of these matches. Do matches vary in
      competitiveness on a consistent basis? Is there evidence that the later sets of a match are more dominated
      by the eventual winner? Also, as a match progresses, is there any way to predict who has the advantage in winning the
      match? What follows may help in answering these questions and more.</p>

      <p>The following analysis is based on all completed matches at majors from 2000-2016 less retirements and walkovers. This
      includes 8,253 matches that are comprised of 30,445 sets and 298,027 games. Please note that all majors, except for the
      U.S. Open, do not use tiebreaks in the final set. This will slightly inflate the fifth-set averages concerning games where 
      applicable.</p>

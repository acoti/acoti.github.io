      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Beginning with the 2019 Australian Open, the number of seeded players at majors will be cut in half to 16, 
      the first time it will be at that number in eighteen years. The expected result is more competitive tennis 
      at the beginning of tournaments. But, from a historical perspective, will this really be the case? That is, 
      after reverting to a draw of 16 seeds, will there be more upsets in the opening rounds? What follows is an 
      analysis of 30,480 men's and women's matches at majors since 1988 that hopes to answer this question.</p>

      <p>In addition, it may be helpful to investigate how often higher-seeded or higher-ranked players actually 
      prevail in any of their matches at majors. Are the chances of a favored player winning a match 
      affected by which round it's played? Are men's favorites more likely to win than women's favorites? Three 
      charts at the end of the report shed some light on this.</p>

      <h2>The Success Rate of Seeded Players By Round</h2>

      <p>From when the Australian Open moved to a 128-player draw in 1988 until Roland Garros in 2001, there were 54 
      majors played with a draw of 16 seeds. This was compared to the 66 majors played through 2017 that had a 
      draw of 32 seeds. To facilitate a more direct comparison, the results from these 66 majors were subdivided 
      into two groups of seeds, 1–16 and 17–32.</p>
      
      <p>Note that the following data represent averages based on the outcome of all matches at majors. It does not consider 
      how an individual player advanced, whether it be from winning a match or due to an opponent's retirement or walkover 
      &mdash; it's simply a calculation of how many players in each category remained after each round. </p>

      <h2>The Competitiveness of Matches at Majors</h2>

      <p>Every match played at a major has a favorite that can be objectively determined by seeding or ranking. That is, if 
      two seeded players compete, then the one who is seeded higher is the favorite; if two unseeded players compete, then the one 
      who is ranked higher is the favorite; if a seeded player competes against an unseeded player, then the seeded player is 
      the favorite.</p>

      <p>Using this as the basis, how often does the favorite actually win a match at a major? The following charts break 
      this down by year, venue and round.</p>
